For this project, several steps were taken to create the final effect. Much time was spent narrowing the question that the project wished to explore and researching similar projects that have already been done. Once this was done, primary sources were chosen to be used for the project. The canonical gospels were accessed through Bible Gateway, an website that publishes online versions of several different Bibles. The New Revised Standard Edition was chosen due to its acceptance among many different Christian denominations. The non-canonical gospels were accessed through the Wesley Center Online, a religious institute through the Northwest Nazarene University. The site offered online versions of 15 different non-canonical gospels. The texts were then read and annotated by labeling each event that occurred throughout the gospel. Once the gospels were annotated, they were then inserted into the program along with a list of the different tags that the gospel included. The program then ran through the texts and tallied the different frequencies of the events in both of the texts, the canonical texts, and just the non-canonical texts. These findings were then visualized in a graph to create a quick way of realizing the different events that each of the gospels covered. This project is subject to interpretation by the creator due to the manner that data was tagged as well as the primary sources that the author chose to use.
