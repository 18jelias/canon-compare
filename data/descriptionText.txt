For thousands of years, scholars and religious leaders have debated the life and actions of Jesus Christ, leading to the development of thousands of texts dissecting his life. Despite having hundreds of texts written about his miracles and preachings, very few writings covered the historical events of Jesus’ life because, after all, he was mainly a religious leader rather than a historical figure. His life, therefore, can only be pieced together through the study and analysis of several texts. Under the multitude of texts that speak of Jesus’ life, two main categories emerge: the canonical and non-canonical gospels. While they both speak to miracles and events that they claim Jesus lived through, each gospel covers different stories of his life, and some even cover the same story differently. By examining these texts as a whole, therefore, additional information can be revealed from the story. After studying the texts, however, direct contradictions do result among the writings, which complicates understanding the historical events of Jesus' life. This project looks at the four main canonical gospels as well as 15 non-canonical gospels to specifically visualize, which set events the gospels share and diverge on. Through this method, the project wishes to answer the question of in what ways and to what degree to the non-canonical gospels and the canonical gospels differ? The project also asks the question of what can this information tell us about the life of Jesus Christ, a key founder in the development of one of the major world religions, Christianity.
